					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>My name is Mason. I can speak coding. To contact me, please email me at me AT, and then masonx DOT ca.</p>
					<ul class="checklist">
						<li>I can solve problems, as demonstrated by my project. Things didn't always go right, but I still managed to try to work around those problems. For example, the CSS stopped working once. I had to problem solve in order to realize that it was because I accidentally typed a " in it somewhere.</li>
						<li>I have some planning skills as I am able to determine a semi-ok colour scheme for my site. I was also able to come up with a usable layout scheme. Finally, I planned out everything in my site fairly ok-ly.</li>
						<li>I demonstrate an understanding of web design because I created a website that I believe works. I like the pictures in my website because pictures are actually awesome, and they are harder to parse compared to plaintext (CSS not included).</li> 
					</ul>
					<p>
						This checks off all of the things on the rubric:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Problem solving skills and resolved issues independently. Give specifics on problems you had and how you used various tools to support you</li>
						<li>Forethought by planning your webpage design, including the colour scheme and layout, as well as your time management</li>
						<li>An understanding of web design.  This is a great spot to talk about what you like about your website</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I also enjoy headers.
					</p>
					<h1>Whether they're huge headers,</h1>
					<h2>Big headers,</h2>
					<h3>Smaller headers,</h3>
					<h4>Even smaller headers,</h4>
					<h5>Tiny headers,</h5>
					<h6>Or even the smallest headers</h6>
					<p>
						I like them all.
