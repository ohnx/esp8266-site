					<h2>Hardware</h2>
					<p>I soldered some wires to my esp8266. It's not the prettiest, but it works. It's probably easier to use a breakout board, or something like that.</p>
					<p>[photo here]</p>
					<p>Then, I plugged everything into a breadboard. The end result is a mess of wires like the one shown in the photo.</p>
					<p>[photo here]</p>
					<p>After that, you should plug things in to the arduino. When plugging things into the arudino, keep in mind that <strong>the esp8266 uses 3.3V, but the arduino uses 5V</strong>. This means that you should plug in the power for the esp8266 into a 3.3V power supply. While you can use the one built into the arduino (like I did), it's not a very good idea as the esp8266 can pull A LOT of current sometimes. Also, the RX and TX pins will be 5V as well. This means you'll have to have a voltage divider on the [RX or TX] pins. Here's a schematic for it:</p>
					<p>[photo here]</p>
					<p>The RX pin goes in pin [pin] on the arduino, and the RX pin in pin [pin]. You can change these values in the program, but keep in mind that not all ports work.</p>
